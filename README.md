Project Overview
This portfolio website serves as a professional representation of my work as a Geospatial Engineer and aspiring Software Developer. It highlights my technical skills, educational journey, personal projects, and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and geospatial engineering.

The website is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Each section is neatly organized and easy to navigate.

Technologies Used
HTML5: The structure of the website is created with HTML5, ensuring semantic and accessible content.

CSS3: All styling is done using plain CSS3. The layout is responsive, using Flexbox for aligning elements.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the website looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

Fonts: Custom fonts like Roboto for headings and Arial for body text are used to ensure clarity and legibility.

Color Scheme: A modern color palette consisting of steelblue, darkslategray, lightyellow, and beige is used for a clean, professional look without overwhelming the user.

Features
Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar remains at the top while scrolling for easy access to other sections.

Profile Picture: The profile picture is centered and circular with a border, creating a personal touch.

Side-by-Side Layout: The skills and education sections, as well as projects and tech & AI interests, are displayed side by side for a modern and efficient layout.

Responsive Design: The site adjusts automatically based on the screen size, ensuring itâ€™s usable on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
